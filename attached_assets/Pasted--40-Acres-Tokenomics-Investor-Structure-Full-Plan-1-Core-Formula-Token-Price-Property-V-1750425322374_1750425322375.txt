🧠 40 Acres Tokenomics & Investor Structure – Full Plan

⚙️ 1. Core Formula
Token Price = Property Valuation ÷ Sq Ft
Max Tokenized Value = 49% of Total Property Value
Token Supply = Max Tokenized Value ÷ Token Price
✅ This ensures legal compliance and protects equity for the property owner while giving room to raise meaningful capital.
🔁 2. Dynamic Token Supply Strategy
📉 Properties < $500,000 → Scarcity Model
Cap supply at 10,000 tokens
Result = Higher token price + premium positioning
📈 Properties ≥ $500,000 → Access Model
Expand supply to 100,000 tokens
Result = Lower token price + higher liquidity & access
🧮 3. Example Calculation (Standardized Format)
Component	Formula	Example (400k, 2,000 sq ft)
Token Price	$400,000 ÷ 2,000 sq ft	$200.00 per token
Max Tokenized Value	$400,000 × 0.49	$196,000
Token Supply	$196,000 ÷ $200	980 tokens
Platform Fee (5%)	$200 × 1.05	$210 fee-inclusive token price
Min Purchase Rule	If < $100 → Min 5 tokens	N/A (since price is $200)
