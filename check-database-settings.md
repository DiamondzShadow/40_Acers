# üìù How to Find Your PostgreSQL Database Password

You're currently looking at **Project API** settings (REST API keys).
We need the **DATABASE** settings (PostgreSQL connection).

## Follow These Steps:

1. In your Supabase Dashboard, look at the LEFT SIDEBAR
2. Click on ‚öôÔ∏è **"Project Settings"** (at the bottom)
3. Then click on **"Database"** (in the settings menu)
4. Scroll down to find **"Connection string"** section
5. You'll see tabs: URI, JDBC, etc.
6. Click on **"URI"** tab
7. Copy the FULL connection string that looks like:
   ```
   postgresql://postgres.kkaidegysdobcmflffey:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
   ```

## Also Look For:

- **"Database Password"** section (above or below the connection string)
- There should be a button to **"Reset database password"**
- If you haven't set a password yet, click that button
- Copy the password it shows you (you only see it once!)

## What To Send Me:

Please copy and paste:
1. The full connection string (with [YOUR-PASSWORD] in it)
2. The actual database password
